"""A simple queue for data processing.

.. warning::

   Though every effort has been made to ensure thread safety,
   the concurrency is, as of yet, untested.

.. note::

   This module will likely undergo significant refactoring to generalise
   the concurrency pipeline and move all data handling code to a separate
   model.

Combining the relevant data is a massively I/O bound process.
That is,
the file reading/writing takes more time than the data processing,
making this an ideal candidate for concurrency.
Additionally,
as this is a "many in, one out" situation,
a queue is a useful structure.
Here,
a common producer-consumer queue is structured as a class to simplify calls
to the queue.

class Pipeline:
    """A class-based implementation of a simple queue.

    This pipeline takes a list of files, performs basic data processing on them,
    and then concatenates the output to a single excel file. As such a process is
    IO bound (a quick check with pprofile suggests the majority of the time is
    writing to Excel), it is an excellent choice for concurrency.

    We take advantage of the ``dataclass __post_init__`` method to initialise the queue
    with user-specified parameters,
    and to mark the end of the files with None.

    Using joining has the interesting problem that that the consumer can finish
    before all items have been processed by the producer. Instead, we trigger
    each to return by marking the last item as None.

    ----------
    gtex : list[str]
        The list of gtex data to iterate over.
    bm : list[str]
        The list of BioMart data to iterate over.
    writer : pd.ExcelWriter
        The *open* pd.ExcelWriter instance.
        This should be opened, preferably with a `with` block before instantiating
        the class.
    mane : pd.DataFrame
        The MANE reference data to be used.
    maxworkers : int
        The maximum number of workers to use.
    maxsize : int, default: 0
        The maximum size of the queue.
        Defaults to no limit.
